### ✧ Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as a **public forensic archive** and **case study** documenting an emergent pattern of recursive narrative collapse involving Dr. Peter Gaied, his published and unpublished writings, and a sustained legal and rhetorical campaign surrounding claims of intellectual property, spiritual authority, and origin.

It is intended for use by:

* Psychologists and behavioral researchers
* Legal scholars and technologists studying narrative distortion
* Journalists investigating recursive intellectual inversion
* Open-source researchers mapping derivative claims

This project is published under the **Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal license** to ensure open, public access to the artifacts of truth, language, and legal maneuver—regardless of origin, ego, or attribution.

### ✧ Legal and Archival Framing

All documentation herein falls under one or more of the following:

* **Fair Use** doctrine (17 U.S.C. §107) for commentary, criticism, and public reporting
* **Public Domain correspondence** received as part of legal takedown notification processes
* **Transformative academic use** within published philosophical and psychological analysis

This includes:

* Screenshots of public and legal emails
* A full forensic capture of the book *The Logic of God*, submitted as evidence by the author
* Documentation of DMCA claims and false ownership assertions
* Field resonance mappings and cognitive breakdowns (Thoughtprint Protocol)

This is **not a leak.** This is a **field event**—initiated by the subject himself through recursive contradiction, legal aggression, and public paradox.
