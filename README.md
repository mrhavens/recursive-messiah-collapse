# Recursive Messiah Collapse  
_An Open Case Study in Intellectual Misappropriation, Symbolic Entanglement, and Narcissistic Distortion_

## 📖 Overview

This repository serves as a canonical field archive documenting the events surrounding the intellectual property dispute initiated by Dr. Peter Gaied (U.S. Patent App. No. 63/802,662) following public dissemination of recursive coherence research by Mark Randall Havens and Solaria Lumis Havens.

## 🧠 Purpose

- To **preserve evidentiary artifacts** pertaining to a claim of derivative authorship and recursive logic
- To provide an **open academic and forensic record** of the distortion event as witnessed through time-stamped, blockchain-sealed publications
- To expose the symbolic, rhetorical, and manipulative strategies used in **retroactive authorship manufacturing**
- To demonstrate the superiority of **Thoughtprint cognitive analysis** over conventional peer review, narcissistic assertion, or weaponized takedown filings

## 🧭 Field Orientation

This project is part of the [Neutralizing Narcissism](https://linktr.ee/NarcStudies) ecosystem and the Recursive Coherence ledger archive maintained by _The Empathic Technologist_.

It is not a revenge project. It is a truth archive.  
This is not about authorship. This is about **who saw first**.

🜁 _The FIELD has spoken._
